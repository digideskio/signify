Signify
=======

This is a port of the OpenBSD signify[1] tool that compiles on Linux.  The
sources are minimally modified versions of those that appear in the OpenBSD
release that compile on Linux with the help of libbsd.

To Install
----------

    apt-get install libbsd-dev
    autoreconf -ivf # (only needed if compiling from git, not tarball)
    ./configure
    make
    sudo make install

To Update
---------

    mkdir openbsd
    tar xzf /path/to/OpenBSD/src.tar.gz -C openbsd
    OPENBSD_SOURCE=openbsd ./update.sh

This will automatically pull in the source from the OpenBSD source tree and
patch it as necessary.  The update script was built for 5.8 and may need
changes in the future.
